# QBitAuth Backend

QBitAuth is an open-source authentication and authorization service designed for the quantum era. Built with **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG)**, it ensures security beyond classical attacks.

## Features

- **Quantum-Safe Security:** Utilizes PQC and QRNG to protect against both classical and quantum adversaries.
- **Next-Gen OAuth Alternative:** Seamless identity flows and token-based access delegation.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All sessions are encrypted for maximum privacy.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Advanced cryptographic techniques for privacy-preserving authentication.

## Technology Highlights

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Future-proof cryptographic algorithms.
- **Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG):** True randomness for secure key generation.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).
- **Quantum-Ready:** Learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography).
